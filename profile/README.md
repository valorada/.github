## Introduction

VALORADA[^1] is a project funded by the European Commission in the framework of the HORIZON EUROPE programme. The goal of the VALORADA project is to empower European regions and cities to steer the upcoming societal transformation towards sustainable and climate-resilient development. The VALORADA project is in line with the [EU Adaptation Mission](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/adaptation-climate-change_en) aiming at supporting the transformation of 150 European regions to become sustainable and climate-resilient by 2030 through:

* The acceleration of societal transformations.
* The demonstration of systemic transformations.
* The improvement of access to and usability of climate data.

## Framework

CONCEPTUAL APPROACH

•	The effects of climate change vary considerably across regions according to distinct physical, environmental, social, cultural, and economic characteristics, resulting in different sensitivities to climate change. 
•	Regional and local authorities produce and collect socioeconomic, demographic, and land-use data and information. These datasets and information can provide meaningful input to characterise climate risk and vulnerability at local scales. 
•	Hence, municipal/regional data and information have a “potential climate value”. But this climate value is not always evident, and it has to be revealed and realised. 

The documentation found here is designed to help local and regional authorities identify, assess, and enhance the “climate value” of the data they collect, in order to better understand and address local climate risks. It introduces practical tools—including Climate Impact Chains, the Adaptation Catalogue, Data Valuation Metrics, and visualization examples—to integrate local data management with climate adaptation planning and decision-making.
Overall, this methodological package aims to support local authorities to tap on the climate value of data and information they produce and collect.
It presents a collection of methodologies that function as a guideline to improve data management practices for the sake of understanding, monitoring and addressing climate risks at local levels. 

In particular, the aim of this methodological package is: 
a. to facilitate prioritise data needs required to support adaptation. 
b. to reveal the climate value of local data and information.
