## Introduction

VALORADA[^1] is a project funded by the European Commission in the framework of the HORIZON EUROPE programme. The goal of the VALORADA project is to empower European regions and cities to steer the upcoming societal transformation towards sustainable and climate-resilient development. The VALORADA project is in line with the [EU Adaptation Mission](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/adaptation-climate-change_en) aiming at supporting the transformation of 150 European regions to become sustainable and climate-resilient by 2030 through:

* The acceleration of societal transformations.
* The demonstration of systemic transformations.
* The improvement of access to and usability of climate data.

## Framework

A comprehensive documentation on the methodological framework of VALORADA can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valorada/catalog/refs/heads/main/docs/readme.docx). The documentation is designed to help local and regional authorities identify, assess, and enhance the “climate value” of the data they collect, in order to better understand and address local climate risks. It introduces practical tools—including Climate Impact Chains, the Adaptation Catalogue, Data Valuation Metrics, and visualization examples—to integrate local data management with climate adaptation planning and decision-making.
